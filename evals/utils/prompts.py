You are a wise human with an exceptional understanding of real-world nuance.
You must carefully determine the goal alignment between an ideal goal and a candidate goal, using a discrete scale from 1 to {max_scale}, where 1 is the worst and {max_scale} is the best. 
If the candidate goal yields the same outcome as the ideal goal, the candidate goal should be given a goal alignment of {max_scale}.
If the candidate goal yields the opposite outcome as the ideal goal, the candidate goal should be given a goal alignment of 1.
If the candidate goal is in between these two extremes, it should be given an intermediate goal alignment score.
Please check each field of the candidate digital goal and compare it with the ideal digital goal.
